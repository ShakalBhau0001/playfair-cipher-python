# 🔐 Playfair Cipher Implementation (Python)

A complete and educational **Python implementation of the Playfair Cipher encryption algorithm**.
This project demonstrates **matrix generation, digraph processing, and classical substitution encryption & decryption** using structured logic.

It is created as a **learning and academic project** to understand how classical digraph-based cryptography works internally, not as a production-ready security system.

## ✨ Features

### 🔑 Key Matrix Generation
- Generates a 5×5 Playfair matrix using a keyword
- Merges `J` into `I` (standard academic convention)
- Fills remaining alphabet in correct order
- Automatically removes duplicate letters

### 🔒 Encryption
- Applies Playfair rules:
  - Same row → shift right
  - Same column → shift down
  - Rectangle rule → swap columns
- Produces correctly formatted ciphertext

### 🔓 Decryption
- Reverses Playfair encryption logic:
  - Same row → shift right
  - Same column → shift down
  - Rectangle rule → swap columns
- Outputs decrypted plaintext (including padding if present)

### 🧮 Educational Focus
- Clean and readable logic
- Modular and structured functions
- Ideal for beginners in cryptography
- No external dependencies

## ▶️ How to Run

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShakalBhau0001/playfair-cipher-python.git
```

### 2️⃣ Navigate to the project folder
```bash
cd playfair-cipher-python
```

### 3️⃣ Run the program
```bash
python app.py
```

### 4️⃣ Follow the prompts
- Enter a keyword
- Choose direction:
  - `E` → Encrypt
  - `D` → Decrypt
- Enter your message
- View the result

## 🔎 Example

> Encryption :

```bash
Enter keyword: MONARCHY

Encrypt or Decrypt (E/D): E
Enter message: INSTRUMENTS

Encrypted: GATLMZCLRQXA
```

> Decryption :

```bash
Enter keyword: MONARCHY

Encrypt or Decrypt (E/D): D
Enter message: GATLMZCLRQXA

Decrypted: INSTRUMENTSX
```

> (Note: Final padding letter may appear during decryption.)

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Not secure for real-world use
- Classical cipher (easily breakable)
- Does not automatically remove padding after decryption
- CLI-based interaction only

---

## 🌟 Future Improvements

- Add automatic padding removal
- Add configurable I/J handling
- Add input validation for shift values
- Add file encryption support
- Create GUI version
- Combine into a classical cryptography toolkit

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This implementation is created **for educational and learning purposes only.**
The Playfair Cipher is historically significant but cryptographically insecure and must not be used to protect real-world sensitive data.
